Hi! I'm Jeff, and I'm fascinated by the opportunities for change happening in the emerging mediums within technology and culture.  I used to work strictly in television, even finding myself with some upward mobility before burning out on the redundancy and stale culture of producing non-scripted and scripted television.   Through my love of film and art, I have strived for the next mediums to further progress not only our inherent stories, but the dialogue of progress we are all involved with!  Please feel free to contact me with any thoughts on Virtual Reality, Open-Source, Web-Development, Blockchain and so forth; I am just a student of these emerging fields, but I intend to harness these tools with the upmost of my abilities!

Cheers,
Jeff
